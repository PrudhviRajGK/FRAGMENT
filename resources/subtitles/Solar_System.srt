00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,138
Welcome to our solar system, a cosmic neighborhood that revolves

2
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:10,379
around the sun.

3
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:14,405
Here, we have eight planets, each with their unique features

4
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:15,209
and characteristics.

5
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:18,924
Closer to the sun, we find the inner planets: Mercury,

6
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:20,409
Venus, Earth, and Mars.

7
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:25,109
These terrestrial planets are small, dense, and have rocky surfaces.

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,682
Further out are the outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and

9
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:30,139
Neptune.

10
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:34,293
These gas giants are much larger and composed mainly of

11
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:35,540
hydrogen and helium.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,363
Between Mars and Jupiter lies the asteroid belt, a band

13
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:43,187
of rocky, icy objects left over from the early solar

14
00:00:43,187 --> 00:00:43,570
system.
